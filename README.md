Using HTML and CSS, I created a website that displays my visualizations and includes written analysis. Using Plotly, I created graphs that compares various attributes of a city weather dataset that I was provided. The attributes I chose to visualize and analysis reveal how a city's weather changes the closer it is to the equator.
