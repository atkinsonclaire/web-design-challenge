# Web-Design-Challenge

Previously, I created graphs that compares various attributes of the cities.csv dataset. The attributes I chose to visualize and analyze reveal how a city's weather changes the closer it is to the equator. I compared the city's latitude to the following characteristics: maximum recorded temperature, average humidity levels, average cloudiness levels and average wind speed. The weather attributes were pulled using the OpenWeather API and saved into a csv through Jupyter Notebooks.

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot. These pages contains the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where one can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where one can view the data used to build them. All seven pages are located in the docs folder. My dashboard is powered by HTML and CSS.

Landing Page:
